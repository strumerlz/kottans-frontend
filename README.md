  #### What was new:
 The level of my Git knowledge was completely zero before this course.
 Frankly, as a beginner I used to avoide this topic, because I thought it's
 too early for me to learn it. But thanks to Kottans I've finally dived into it.
 And I think the [resources](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) that were provided are the best choise to start with.
 Especially the [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) game!
 That's an awesome way to learn, thanks for offering it.
   
  #### What surprised me:
  Git basics have been not so hard as I first feared. But "Remote/1.8 Locked Master" level made me look hard into reference documentation to pass it in only 3 steps!  What I'm going to use in the future? Hmm..is there something that i'm NOT going to use?))
  I think I'll use all of these commands.
